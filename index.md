<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am a PhD student at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) in Saudi Arabia. I am part of [Vision-CAIR group](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vision-cair) led by [Pr. Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iRBUTOAAAAAJ). Previously, I obtained a Master of Arts in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/), and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/). 

My research is primarily focused on **enhancing the foundation models with emerging abilities and properties**. This endeavor is reflected in my previous and on-going works, including topics of model alignment, continual/zero-shot learning, and efficient training algorithms.
