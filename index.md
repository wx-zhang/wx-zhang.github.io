I am a forth-year Ph.D. candidate at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) in Saudi Arabia. I am part of [Vision-CAIR group](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vision-cair) led by [Pr. Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iRBUTOAAAAAJ).   My research lies in **enhancing the foundation models with emerging abilities and properties**, including but not limited to:
- Improving the safety and helpfulness of foundation models.
- Adapting LLM/VLMs for long and complex tasks.
- Overcoming the forgetting during the model update.
