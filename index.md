<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am PhD student at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), and an engineer from [ENSIMAG](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/).
I earned a Master of Research in Data Science from [Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA)](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), during which I worked with [Dr. Adrian Popescu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fjsa2GYAAAAJ&hl=en) on class-incremental learning for image classification at [Université Paris-Saclay (CEA-LIST)](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).
I am currently supervised by [Pr. Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iRBUTOAAAAAJ), and am interested in various computer vision topics, including compositional and continual learning, and 2D/3D vision methods.

My research interests gravitate around **3D computer vision**, **compositional learning**, and paradigms like **continual/few-shot/zero-shot learning** which are all essential to making artificial neural networks closer to the learning abilities of biological systems.
