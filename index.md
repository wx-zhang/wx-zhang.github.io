I am a forth-year Ph.D. candidate at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) in Saudi Arabia. I am part of [Vision-CAIR group](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vision-cair) led by [Pr. Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iRBUTOAAAAAJ).   My research lies in **enhancing the foundation models with emerging abilities and properties**, including but not limited to:
- Fine-tuning and aligning foundation models with reinforcement learning.
- Efficient Training and Continual Learning. Parameter-efficient methods, mitigating forgetting, and learning under constrained computation.
- Agents. Building autonomous LLM/VLM agents with enhanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities.
