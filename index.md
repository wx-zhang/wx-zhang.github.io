<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am PhD student at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/).
I earned a Master of Arts in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/), during which I worked with [Prof. Eric Eaton](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/eric-eaton/) on lifelong learning at [Universit√© Paris-Saclay (CEA-LIST)](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).
I am currently supervised by [Pr. Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iRBUTOAAAAAJ), and am interested in various computer vision topics, including compositional and continual learning, and 2D/3D vision methods.

My research interests gravitate around **3D computer vision**, **compositional learning**, and paradigms like **continual/few-shot/zero-shot learning** which are all essential to making artificial neural networks closer to the learning abilities of biological systems.
